# Power BI P&L Dashboard: Turning Data into Insights  

I recently built a **Profit & Loss (P&L) dashboard**, integrating a **Decomposition Tree** alongside a **table with conditional formatting** to make financial analysis more intuitive. The dashboard enables users to drill down into revenue sources, costs, and profit drivers while also providing a structured view of financial figures.  

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… **Dynamic Decomposition Tree** â€“ Easily drill down into financial categories  
âœ… **Conditional Formatting** â€“ Red arrows highlight negative values for quick insights  
âœ… **Variance Analysis** â€“ Compare budgeted vs. actual performance  
âœ… **Structured Financial Hierarchy** â€“ Simplifies complex data for strategic decision-making  

By combining **visual and tabular elements**, this dashboard ensures clarity and accessibility, helping decision-makers quickly identify financial trends.  

ðŸ’¡ **What techniques or visuals do you use to enhance P&L reporting? Let's discuss!**
